# PRs - follow three simple rules

1. Before a PR can be merged, it must pass the tests.
2. Before a PR can be merged, it shouldn't reduce the test coverage.
3. Bugfixes go in PRs and a bugfix PR shouldn't be merged without a regression test.

# Releases - follow one simple rule:

1. Tests must pass.
