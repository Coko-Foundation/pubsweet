## Reporting a Bug

We take all security bugs in PubSweet seriously and we thank you for improving its security. 
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead developer, Jure Triglav, at jure (at) coko.foundation.

The lead developer will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a
more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will
try to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

You can also report a vulnerability through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/security#reporting-security-problems-to-npm), with the option of submitting a vunerability directly for a specific package, e.g. [`pubsweet`](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/report?package=pubsweet).

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible to npm.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
merge request.
