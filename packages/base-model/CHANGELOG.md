# 1.0.0 (2018-09-20)


### Features

* add base-model package for standalone data models ([fc446e8](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/pubsweet/pubsweet/commit/fc446e8)), closes [#395](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/pubsweet/pubsweet/issues/395)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* In PubSweet server, the exported thing is no longer startServer directly, but it's
now part of the exported object. This will break applications that use the equivalent of const
startServer = require('pubsweet-server'). The new method for getting a startServer is const {
startServer } = require('pubsweet-server').
