This is a text input component (with validations) meant to be used in PubSweet applications.

```js
<FormGroup
  controlId='fragment.title'
  label='Title'
  placeholder='One fine day...'
  modelProperty='fragment.title'
  inputRef={(input) => { this.title = input }}
/>
```

The `modelProperty` tells the component which model and property this input field is describing, for example, `user.name` or `collection.title`. Validations for the input field will then be based on the validations for that specific model and property (defined in `pubsweet-server` and your configuration).

You can then get the value like so:

```js static
var title = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this.title).value
```
