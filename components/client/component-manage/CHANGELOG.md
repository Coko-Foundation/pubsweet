# [1.0.0](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/pubsweet/pubsweet/compare/pubsweet-component-manage@0.2.4...pubsweet-component-manage@1.0.0) (2018-07-02)


### Bug Fixes

* **components:** import Manage styles in component ([6f0e443](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/pubsweet/pubsweet/commit/6f0e443))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **components:** Manage.scss is now required in the component itself. Since this was usually
required from the app itself, this would now result in double importing of styles.
