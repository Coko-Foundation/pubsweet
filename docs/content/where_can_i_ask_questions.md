So. You've got this far and you're eager to get started. But you still have _so many questions!_

If you have any questions about PubSweet – from doubts about how it would fit in your organization, to queries about specific error messages – or you just want to say hello, your starting point should be the [Coko Mattermost chat server](https://mattermost.coko.foundation 'undefined'). It has a number of channels such as `#xpub` or `#PubSweet`, so if you know where your question fits, feel free to go directly to those channels. If you're unsure, go for `#Town Square`, and we'll figure it out together.

The PubSweet community is worldwide, so there's usually someone around to field questions, no matter the hour. They may not know the answer, but they should be able to direct you to someone who does.

If you already know your question relates to a bug or feature request, then you can go straight to the [PubSweet GitLab repository](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/pubsweet/pubsweet 'undefined') (it's just one repository for all packages, so no need to go looking for the right place), and create a new issue.
